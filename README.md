# Star-Cluster-Analysis-NGC1300

This project involves the analysis of star clusters within the NGC 1300 galaxy, using photometric data and theoretical evolutionary tracks to classify clusters by age and symmetry. The analysis also includes overlaying young, middle-aged, and old-aged clusters over CO moment maps from ALMA to study their distribution within the galaxy.

## Introduction

This project aims to understand the properties and distributions of star clusters in the NGC 1300 galaxy. The analysis focuses on classifying star clusters into different age groups based on photometric data and examining their spatial distribution using CO moment maps.

## Usage

Helps the user to gain basic knowledge about few data analysis techniques: Aperture Photometry, Color Magnitude diagrams and helps develop solid understanding about star clusters.

## Data Sources

The data used in this project was all taken from PHANGS-HST archive and Alma space archive.

## Results

The analysis revealed that:

- Young clusters (1-100 million years) are concentrated on the arms of the galaxy.
- Middle-aged clusters are found between the arms and the galactic center.
- Old-aged clusters are mostly concentrated at the center of the galaxy.
